### Research quality assessment

---

#### Researcher's h-index (Hirsch index)

>  A scientist has index `h` if `h` of his/her N<sub>p</sub> papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other (N<sub>p</sub> âˆ’ `h`) papers have no more than `h` citations each.

<small>Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index)</small>

<!-- A researcher with a h-index of 35 has 35 of its publications cited at least 35 times -->

---

#### Journal impact factor

> In any given year, the impact factor of a journal is the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the two preceding years.

## Open Science

---

### A definition

> Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.

---

### Another definition

> Open Science describes the on-going transitions in the way research is performed, researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organised. [...] facilitating more transparency, openness, networking, collaboration, and refocuses science from a 'publish or perish' perspective to a knowledge-sharing perspective.

### Open Science in 2015

* Open Science now is where Open Source was 10 years ago
* Sharing data is not enough
